## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

List of favorite apps: 

    ○ Pinterest 
        • Ability to save and organize inspiration into boards. 
        • The Home Feed shows recommended pins based on the user's interests. 
        • Pins are displayed in a visually appealing grid format that makes it
        fun to scroll. 
    ○ Spotify 
        • Ability to change playlist covers. 
        • Users are able to like songs in addition to adding them to a playlist. 
        • Recommends similar songs under each playlist. 
    ○ Letterboxd 
        • Ability to review, like, and add movies to lists. 
        • Ability to interact with other users through comments. 
        • Watchlist feature for users to add movies they would like to see. 
        
App Idea: 
An app I would like to build would combine elements from my favorite apps, such
as Pinterest and Letterboxd. The idea would be to expand on Pinterest's
recommendation system and apply it to movie recommendations. A feature I've
always wished to find on movie rating apps is personalized recommendations. The
app would allow users to select their interests from a range of categories, like
music, artists, photography, genres, and directors, and use this information to
recommend movies they might enjoy. This process can be refined over time as the
user watches more movies and rates them. 

## Notes

• I faced a small setback while learning how to move my Xcode project into the
GitHub repository properly.
